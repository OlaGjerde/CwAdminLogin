# Troubleshooting: CloudFront AccessDenied Error

## Error: AccessDenied on https://dev.calwincloud.com/

This error typically occurs when CloudFront can't access your S3 bucket due to permission issues.

---

## Common Causes & Solutions

### 1. âœ… S3 Bucket Policy Missing or Incorrect

CloudFront needs permission to read from your S3 bucket. You need a bucket policy that allows CloudFront to access the objects.

#### Solution: Update S3 Bucket Policy

Go to **S3 Console** â†’ Your Bucket â†’ **Permissions** tab â†’ **Bucket Policy**

**For Origin Access Control (OAC) - RECOMMENDED:**

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowCloudFrontServicePrincipal",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "AWS:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudfront::YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID:distribution/YOUR-DISTRIBUTION-ID"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

**Replace:**
- `YOUR-BUCKET-NAME` - Your S3 bucket name (e.g., `dev-calwincloud-frontend`)
- `YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID` - Your AWS account ID (12 digits)
- `YOUR-DISTRIBUTION-ID` - Your CloudFront distribution ID (e.g., `E1ABCDEFGHIJKL`)

### 2. âœ… Origin Access Control (OAC) Not Configured

CloudFront might not be configured to use Origin Access Control to access your S3 bucket.

#### Solution: Configure Origin Access Control

**Step 1: Create OAC (if not already created)**
1. Go to **CloudFront Console**
2. Click **Origin access** in the left menu
3. Click **Create origin access control**
4. Name: `dev-calwincloud-oac`
5. Description: "OAC for dev.calwincloud.com"
6. Signing behavior: **Sign requests (recommended)**
7. Click **Create**

**Step 2: Update CloudFront Distribution**
1. Go to your CloudFront distribution
2. Click **Origins** tab
3. Select your S3 origin
4. Click **Edit**
5. Scroll to **Origin access**
6. Select **Origin access control settings (recommended)**
7. Choose your OAC from dropdown (or create new)
8. Click **Save changes**

**Step 3: Copy the Bucket Policy**
After saving, CloudFront will show a **blue banner** with:
> "Policy update required: The S3 bucket policy needs to be updated. Copy the policy below and add it to the bucket."

Click **Copy policy** and paste it into your S3 bucket policy!

### 3. âœ… S3 Block Public Access Settings

Even with a bucket policy, if "Block Public Access" settings are too restrictive, it can cause issues.

#### Solution: Verify Block Public Access Settings

Go to **S3 Console** â†’ Your Bucket â†’ **Permissions** tab â†’ **Block public access**

**Recommended settings for CloudFront:**
```
Block all public access: âœ… ON (safe - CloudFront uses OAC, not public access)
  â”œâ”€ Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new access control lists (ACLs): âœ… ON
  â”œâ”€ Block public access to buckets and objects granted through any access control lists (ACLs): âœ… ON
  â”œâ”€ Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new public bucket or access point policies: âœ… ON
  â””â”€ Block public access to buckets and objects granted through any public bucket or access point policies: âœ… ON
```

This is **correct** because CloudFront uses OAC (not public access) to read from S3.

---

### 4. âœ… CloudFront Default Root Object Not Set

CloudFront might not know to serve `index.html` when accessing the root URL.

#### Solution: Set Default Root Object

1. Go to **CloudFront Console** â†’ Your Distribution
2. Click **General** tab
3. Click **Edit**
4. Scroll to **Default root object**
5. Enter: `index.html`
6. Click **Save changes**

---

### 5. âœ… Custom Error Pages for SPA Not Configured

Your React/Vite app is a Single Page Application (SPA). CloudFront needs to redirect 404/403 errors to `index.html`.

#### Solution: Configure Custom Error Pages

1. Go to **CloudFront Console** â†’ Your Distribution
2. Click **Error pages** tab
3. Click **Create custom error response**

**Add TWO error responses:**

**Error Response 1 (404):**
- HTTP error code: `404: Not Found`
- Customize error response: **Yes**
- Response page path: `/index.html`
- HTTP response code: `200: OK`
- Click **Create custom error response**

**Error Response 2 (403):**
- HTTP error code: `403: Forbidden`
- Customize error response: **Yes**
- Response page path: `/index.html`
- HTTP response code: `200: OK`
- Click **Create custom error response**

This ensures SPA routing works correctly (e.g., `/login`, `/dashboard` all serve `index.html`).

---

### 6. âœ… CloudFront Cache Needs Invalidation

Old cached errors might still be served even after fixing permissions.

#### Solution: Create Cache Invalidation

1. Go to **CloudFront Console** â†’ Your Distribution
2. Click **Invalidations** tab
3. Click **Create invalidation**
4. Object paths: `/*`
5. Click **Create invalidation**

Wait 1-2 minutes for invalidation to complete, then test again.

---

### 7. âœ… Files Not Uploaded to S3

The S3 bucket might be empty or files in wrong location.

#### Solution: Verify Files in S3

1. Go to **S3 Console** â†’ Your Bucket
2. Check for files:
   - `index.html` (must be at root)
   - `assets/` folder (with JS/CSS files)
   - Other static files

If files are missing:
```powershell
# Re-run deployment
cd "c:\Users\OlaGjerde\CodeRoot\DevExtreme 25.1\awsManageLogin\awslogin"
yarn deploy
```

Or manually:
```powershell
# Build
yarn build

# Upload to S3
aws s3 sync dist/ s3://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME/ --delete
```

---

## Step-by-Step Debugging

### Step 1: Check S3 Bucket Directly

Try accessing S3 bucket directly (won't work if Block Public Access is on, but good test):

```
https://YOUR-BUCKET-NAME.s3.YOUR-REGION.amazonaws.com/index.html
```

**Expected Result:**
- If you get `AccessDenied` â†’ Bucket policy issue
- If you get the file â†’ CloudFront OAC issue
- If you get `NoSuchKey` â†’ Files not uploaded

### Step 2: Check CloudFront Distribution Settings

1. Go to **CloudFront Console** â†’ Your Distribution
2. Verify:
   - **Status**: Deployed âœ…
   - **Distribution domain name**: Matches your Route 53 record
   - **Origin**: Points to your S3 bucket
   - **Default root object**: `index.html`
   - **Origin access**: Origin access control settings

### Step 3: Check CloudFront Error Logs

1. Go to **CloudFront Console** â†’ Your Distribution
2. Click **Monitoring** tab
3. Check **Metrics** for errors
4. Look at **Popular objects** - is `/` being requested?

## Example: Complete S3 Bucket Policy

Here's a complete example (replace the placeholders):

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowCloudFrontServicePrincipal",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::dev-calwincloud-frontend/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "AWS:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudfront::123456789012:distribution/E1ABCDEFGHIJKL"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

**How to find your values:**
- **Bucket name**: Check S3 console
- **Account ID**: Click your username (top right) â†’ Account ID
- **Distribution ID**: CloudFront console â†’ Your distribution â†’ ID column
